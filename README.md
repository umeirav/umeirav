- 👋 Hi, I’m @umeirav
- 👀 I’m interested in Science and Psychology. I have many interests but I love cooking, painting, Carnatic Music and going on walks:)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding and computer programming for psychological research purposes and I've realized that it's not 
easy but also kind of fun!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that could help create a reproducible research report!
- 📫 Best to reach me at uvijendr@uwaterloo.ca! Excited to collaborate!
